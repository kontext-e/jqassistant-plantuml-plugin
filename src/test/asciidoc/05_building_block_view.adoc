== Building Block View

This section describes the PlantUML Plugin modules which you will also find in the
Java package structure.

=== Level 1


The following UML package diagram shows the main building blocks of the system and their interdependencies:

package scanner {}
package store {
    package descriptor {}
}

| scanner       | de.kontext_e.jqassistant.plugin.plantuml.scanner              | Scan a text file and create Neo4j nodes for packages and relationships for links.
| store         | de.kontext_e.jqassistant.plugin.plantuml.store                | contains jQAssistant store interfaces.
| descriptor    | de.kontext_e.jqassistant.plugin.plantuml.store.descriptor     | contains jQAssistant compliant descriptors for Neo4j nodes.

==== Known Technical Debt

*Unwanted Dependencies*

During the lifetime many features were added. For some of them, a building block needs information stored in
a different building block or has to call functionality of another building block - but these new connections
lead to circular dependencies. To keep the System maintainable, the architecture must be improved:
resolve dependency circles, move responsibilities etc. Open tasks are:

| de.kontext_e.demo.one     | de.kontext_e.demo.two | Because one makes StatusDTO out of ReceivedMessage from two to hold a list of Sensor stati; Todo: let the ProcessSensorStatusCommand convert the ReceivedMessage into StatusDTO

==== Open Issues
* only basic package diagrams are tested
* no support for classes
* no support for other diagrams
